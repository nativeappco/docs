This Stork Credit feature allows you to set up rules—similar to native Shopify discounts—that automatically issue store credit based on customer spending behaviour.

## 1\. Start a Promotion

From the app dashboard, click to add automatic store credit from scratch, or browse templates such as "Cash back on orders," "Spend and get credit," or "Buy 3 get credit."

## 2\. Define Rewards

Set the reward rules using fixed amounts or percentages (e.g., Spend $20, get $10 store credit). There are also a list of pre-configured templates to help you get started.

## 3\. Set Requirements

*   **Products:** Apply the rule to all products or specific collections/products.
    
*   **Minimums:** Set a minimum purchase amount (e.g., $20).
    
*   **Eligibility:** Choose specific customer segments or individual customers if desired.
    

## 4\. Schedule

Set a start date and an optional end date for the promotion.

### 5\. Activate

Once created, the promotion may default to "Inactive." Click the **Activate** button to push it live.

## Other options

*   **Prevent Stacking:** In the app settings, you can toggle **"Best Value Only"** on. This ensures that if multiple promotions run simultaneously, the customer only receives the single best offer per order rather than stacking them.
    
*   **Activity Logs:** You can view logs for any activity to see exactly when and how credit was created.
