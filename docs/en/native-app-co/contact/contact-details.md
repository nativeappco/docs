## Contact us from inside the app

In apps that include a support shortcut, you can message us directly from the app’s main screen:

<m-steps><m-step title="Open the Dashboard">From your Shopify admin, open the app and go to the <strong>Dashboard</strong>.</m-step> <m-step title="Use the Customer Service button">Select the <strong>Customer Service</strong> button (shown on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>) to send us a message.</m-step> <m-step title="Include the essentials">Tell us what you’re trying to do, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead.</m-step> </m-steps> <m-tip>If you’re contacting us about a storefront issue, include the theme name you’re working on (for example, your live theme vs. a draft theme) and any recent changes you made right before the issue started.</m-tip>

## What to include so we can help faster

*   **Your Shopify store URL** (or the store name)
*   **The app name** you’re using (for example, **Omnibus Owl** or **Stork Credit**)
*   **Where you were in the app** (for example, **Dashboard** or **Theme Settings**)
*   **Screenshots** of what you’re seeing (if possible)
*   **Any deadlines** (for example, “launching today”)

<m-info>We love feedback and feature requests. If there’s a workflow you want to achieve (even if you’re not sure the app supports it), send us the goal and we’ll recommend the best approach.</m-info>
