# Meta Integration

With just a few clicks, you can set up tracking for “Add to Wishlist” events, which helps you reach customers on social media based on what they love.

### Key Benefits

1.  **Track Wishlist Events**:  
    Automatically sends “Add to Wishlist” data to Meta, which you can use to create ads for Facebook and Instagram. This includes:
    *   **Product IDs**: Tracks which product was added to the wishlist.
    *   **Product Names**: Captures the item name for better reporting and targeting.
2.  **Simple Setup in Admin Settings**:  
    Meta tracking is pre-enabled in your app's admin settings, so it's ready to go right away. For stores with custom tracking, you can easily turn off this feature if needed.

### How It Works

1.  **Easy Configuration**:  
    By default, Meta Integration is switched on. You can go to Admin -> Settings to verify it or disable it if your store has another tracking setup.

2.  **Tracking in Action**:  
    When a customer adds an item to their wishlist, Fish Wishlist sends the “Add to Wishlist” event directly to Meta with all the details.
3.  **Verify with Meta Pixel Helper**:  
    Use the Meta Pixel Helper Chrome extension to confirm tracking is active. If the pixel isn’t detected, check your store’s theme and ensure custom scripts are enabled.

### Example Data

*   **Product ID**: Sent with the event as `content_ids`.
*   **Product Name**: Captured as `content_name` for easy identification.

### Troubleshooting

*   **Already Have a Pixel?** No problem. Just turn off the Meta Integration in settings if your store has its own tracking solution.
*   **Extensions Not Detecting**: If there’s an issue with detection, double-check that tracking is enabled in your store theme settings.
