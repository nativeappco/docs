# Print Add to Wishlist QR Codes



{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available for all stores using Fish Wishlist. You do not need to use Shopify POS.
{% endhint %}

### Benefits:

* **Instant Wishlist Saves**: Customers can scan a barcode on any product in-store and immediately save it to their wishlist.
* **Shopify POS Integration**: If using Shopify POS, staff can easily access a customer’s wishlist directly within their profile.
* **Online Accessibility**: Even without Shopify POS, customers can always access their wishlist online.
* **Enhanced Marketing Campaigns**: Wishlist data can be integrated with your marketing platforms to power customer reminders, sale notifications, and back-in-stock alerts.

### How it works:

The QR Code Add to Wishlist Function allows customers to effortlessly add products to their wishlist by simply scanning a QR code.

* Stores can print "add to wishlist" QR codes directly on their product labels.
* When a customer scans the QR code, it opens the store's website and triggers the wishlist add function for the specified product variant.
* An example URL for adding an item to a wishlist is: `https://fish-wishlist.myshopify.com/?fvid=<variantid>&opendrawer=true`
* The `opendrawer` parameter is optional and, if included, will open the wishlist drawer after the item is added.

* To create QR codes for all your products, you first need to export a list of product variant IDs using an app such as Matrixify. The variant ID is the only column you need for generating your QR code URLs, however you may wish to also export other columns such as SKU, barcode, title & price.
* Once you have your data, you need to create a list of URLs in the following format: `https://<yourdomain.com>/?fvid=<variantid>&opendrawer=true`
  * \<yourdomain.com> = your store's domain
  * \<variantid> = the variant ID of the product you want to add to wishlist (this is a value generated by Shopify. It is different to your SKU and barcode.
* You may have existing barcode printing software that can print the barcodes. If not, there are lots of [online tools](https://www.google.com/search?q=bulk+qr+code+generator) available that can generate QR codes in bulk.
