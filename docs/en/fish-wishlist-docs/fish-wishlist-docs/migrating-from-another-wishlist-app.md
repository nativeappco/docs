# Migrating from another Wishlist App

#### Supported Apps

We can assist with migrations from most major Shopify wishlist apps, including:

* Swym
* Growave
* Smart Wishlist
* Wishlist Plus

#### How to Migrate

1. Export your data: From your previous app’s dashboard, export your wishlist data as a CSV file. Depending on the app, you may need to contact their support team to get an export.
2. Ensure Customer Emails are included: For the best results, ensure your export includes the `Customer Email`, `Product Handle`, and `Variant ID`.
3. Send it to us: Email your CSV file to [support@nativeappco.com](mailto:support@nativeappco.com)
4. We handle the rest: Our team will format the data and import it directly into your Shopify Customer Metafields.

> Note: Because Fish Wishlist uses native Shopify Metafields, once your data is migrated, you "own" it forever—even if you decide to change wishlist apps later. You can export your wishlist data using an app such as Matrixify.
