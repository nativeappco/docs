# Managing Product Variants

#### Saving Specific Variants

By default, the app is designed to capture the `Variant ID` currently selected on the product page. If a user selects "Large" and "Blue," that is exactly what will appear in their wishlist.

#### Enabling the Variant Selector

If you want customers to be able to change their mind (e.g., change the size) directly from the wishlist drawer:

1. Go to Settings in the Fish Wishlist app.
2. Toggle on Enable Variant Selector in Drawer.
3. Click Save.

#### Troubleshooting "Default Title"

If your shared wishlists are showing "Default Title" instead of the product name, this usually means the theme isn't passing the product title correctly to the sharing metadata. Please contact support, and we can add a small snippet to your theme to fix this instantly.
