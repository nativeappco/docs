# Enabling Collaborator Access

#### Why we request access

If you are experiencing a theme conflict (like the wishlist heart not appearing or a mini-cart error), we need access to your theme files to apply a custom fix.

#### Our Safety Protocol

* Duplicate Themes: We never work on your live theme. We will always create a duplicate of your current theme, apply the fixes there, and ask you to preview it before any changes go live.
* Limited Access: We only request access to "Apps" and "Online Store." We do not need access to your finances, orders, or private customer data.

#### How to approve

When we request access, you will receive an email from Shopify (request will come from "Native App Co". You can also find the request in your Shopify Admin under Settings > Users and Permissions.
