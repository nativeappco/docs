# Wishlist Section On Any Page

#### Key Benefits & Use Cases

This section is a powerful tool for driving conversions by reminding customers of the items they intended to purchase. Use the Wishlist Page section to:

* **Boost Conversions on Product/Collection Pages:** Place the section _Above your Related Products_ on PDPs (Product Detail Pages) or PLPs (Product Listing Pages) to encourage customers to add a desired item to their cart before they browse similar products.
* **Engage Shoppers on the Homepage**: Feature a customer's saved products directly on your homepage to personalize the shopping experience from the moment they arrive.
* **Enhance Loyalty Programs**: Display a customer's personalized wishlist on Loyalty or Promotion pages to motivate them to redeem points or meet a spending threshold.
