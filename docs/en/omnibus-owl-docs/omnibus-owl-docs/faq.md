# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to know how to code to install the price widget?**  
A: Not at all! You can easily install the widget using Shopify's App Blocks and App Embeds directly from your Theme Editor. If your theme doesn't support app blocks, we also offer a simple Manual CSS Selector option to place the widget exactly where you want it without touching the code.

**Q: Can I track price history from before I installed the app?**  
A: No. Due to Shopify's limitations, we can only start tracking your price history the moment you install the app. We cannot go back and check historical prices from before your installation date.

**Q: How many days of price history does the app display?**  
A: By default, the app tracks and displays the lowest price over the last 30 days to comply with EU laws. However, you can increase this tracking window up to 365 days in your settings.

**Q: Will the price history show on products that aren't currently on sale?**  
A: By default, the price history only appears on products that are actively on sale. However, you can easily change this in your settings if you'd prefer to display the widget on all of your products.

**Q: Can I translate the price widget into other languages?**  
A: Yes! Omnibus Owl integrates perfectly with Shopify Markets, allowing you to translate the widget into any language you have set up on your store. You can use automatic translations or manually edit the text to fit your brand.

**Q: Does the app track price changes I make on Draft or Archived products?**  
A: It can, but you have the option to turn off tracking for draft and archived products in your settings. This is highly recommended so that temporary price adjustments made before publishing a product aren't tracked as your official lowest price.

**Q: What is the "Auto-Compare At Price" feature?**  
A: By default, Shopify doesn't automatically move your original price into the "Compare at price" field when you put an item on sale. Our Auto-Compare At Price feature automates this for you, moving the original price into the compare at field the moment you drop the price.

**Q: Do you delete metafield data after I uninstall Omnibus Owl**  
A: No, we do not delete your price history data when you uninstall the app. This is to prevent situations where you could accidentally delete all of your price history data. If you would like to delete this data, please contact us.
