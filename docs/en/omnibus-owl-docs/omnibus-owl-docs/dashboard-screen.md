The Dashboard is your command center for Omnibus Owl, giving you a top-down view of your store's price tracking status.

### What You Can Do on the Dashboard:

*   **Tracked Metrics:** Instantly see how many products and total variants are currently being monitored by the app.
*   **Toggle Price Monitoring:** You have the ability to turn price monitoring off at any time.
*   **Theme Settings:** Quickly jump to the settings of your installation on other themes (helpful if you are working on a draft theme or launching a new storefront).
*   **Customer Support:** Access our dedicated Customer Service button, prominently displayed so you can send us a message whenever you need help. We will always respond to you as quickly as we can.

### Individual Product Search

If you need to audit a specific item, you can use the search bar on the Dashboard to find any individual product (e.g., searching for "Sneakers"). Clicking on a product will reveal its exact price history timeline, showing you the exact dates when the product was edited and what the price was changed to.
