Omnibus Owl integrates with **Shopify Markets**, allowing you to translate the price widget into any language you have set up on your store.

## Managing Translations

1.  Navigate to the **Languages** page in the app.
2.  You will see a list of your active languages (e.g., English, Japanese).
3.  While some languages feature automatic translations, you can manually edit any text string to fit your brand's voice.

## Customizing Widget Messages

*   **Main Label:** You can change the default text (e.g., _"Lowest price in the last 30 days"_). You can also add HTML here—for example, to make the label bold.
*   **EU Directive Tooltip:** If you have the info tooltip enabled, you can customize the explanatory text regarding the EU Omnibus Directive that appears when a customer hovers over the info icon. Make sure this aligns with what you want to say before turning the app on for your store.
*   **Date Format:** Set your date format to whatever you want.
