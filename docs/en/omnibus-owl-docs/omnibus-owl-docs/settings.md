The Settings page allows you to fine-tune how Omnibus Owl behaves on your storefront and manages your data.

## Lowest Price Widget

Control exactly how and when the price block appears to your customers:

*   **Show Only on Discounted Products:** Toggle this ON so the widget only appears when a product is actively on sale. If turned OFF, the price history will display on all products.
*   **Current Price Calculation:** By default (to align with the EU Omnibus directive), the widget only considers prices _before_ the current price reduction when calculating the lowest 30-day price. However, you can toggle a setting to include the current price in that calculation if you prefer.
*   **Info Tooltip:** Turn on the info tooltip to display a small info button next to the price. When hovered over, it displays the message configured in your Language Settings.

## Price History Tracking

Manage how data is collected and stored:

*   **Tracking Duration:** By default, the app tracks and calculates the lowest price over the last **30 days** (the standard EU requirement). You can increase this tracking window up to **365 days**. _(Note: If you need to go beyond 365 days, please contact our support team)_.
*   **Important Limitation:** Tracking begins immediately after you install the app. Because of Shopify's limitations, we won't be able to go back and check historical prices from before that date.
*   **Exclude Drafts & Archives:** You can turn off tracking for draft and archived products. This is highly recommended so that temporary price adjustments made before you publish a product aren't tracked.

## Smart Pricing Tools

Go beyond compliance and automate your merchandising with these built-in tools:

### Auto-Compare At Price

Shopify doesn't automatically do this by default, but Omnibus now does. When enabled, this feature automatically takes your original price and moves it into the "Compare at price" field the moment you put a product on sale, ensuring your original price appears anywhere on the site as a compare at price.

### Fresh Drop Dynamic Tagging

Automatically tag products when they drop in price to power automated collections:

*   **How it works:** When a product's price drops below its 30-day lowest, the app will automatically apply a tag to the product (the default tag is `sale`).
*   **Automate Collections:** You can use that tag to set up a collection on your page called "Just on sale".
*   **Auto-Remove:** Set the app to automatically remove that tag after 7 days. This takes it out of the "Just on sale" collection automatically.
