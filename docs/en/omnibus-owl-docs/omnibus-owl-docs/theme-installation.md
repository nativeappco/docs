## Theme Installation

Installing the Omnibus Owl price block on your storefront is quick and requires no coding.

## Step 1: Enable the App Embed

1.  After installing the app from the Shopify App Store, you will be greeted by the **Quick Theme Setup** screen.
2.  Select the theme you want to install the app onto (e.g., your live theme).
3.  Click the button to enable the app. This will open the **Shopify Theme Editor**.
4.  In the Theme Editor, ensure the Omnibus app embed toggle is turned **ON**.
5.  Click **Save** in the top right corner.
6.  Return to the app and click the **Verify** button to ensure the embed was activated successfully.

## Step 2: Add the Price Block to Your Product Page

The Price Block is the visual element that displays the updated price history to your customers.

1.  Open the **Shopify Theme Editor** and navigate to your **Default Product** page template.
2.  Add the block to your Product Information section.
3.  Drag and drop the block to your desired location (we recommend placing it just below the product price or the "Buy It Now" buttons).
4.  Click **Save**. By default, the price history will only appear on products that are actively on sale.

## Alternative: Manual Installation (CSS Selector)

If your theme doesn't support app blocks or you are having trouble placing it automatically, you can use the Manual CSS Selector method:

1.  In the app setup screen, choose **Manual CSS Selector**.
2.  Find the CSS class of the element you want to attach the widget to (e.g., `product-form`).
3.  Enter the class name and choose whether you want to insert the widget **Before**, **After**, or **Inside** that specific element.
4.  Click **Save**.
