Omnibus Owl integrates seamlessly with **Shopify Flow**, allowing you to build automated backend workflows based on your catalog's price history.

Shopify Flow does not have a trigger for product price update, so this feature is very useful for both your marketing and back of house teams.

<m-info><p>Here is an example of a Shopify Flow that automatically adds tags to a product after its price drops.</p><p><img class="tiptap-image" src="https://cdn.heymantle.com/orgs/26a47f7d-a3b9-42a0-97fc-a4835cc43fbe/assets/91e7b79f-59fb-4a82-a165-9475a0770ca5/image.png" alt="image"></p></m-info>

Whenever a price change is detected, Omnibus Owl can trigger specific actions in your store.

We provide two distinct Shopify Flow triggers:

*   **Price Drop:** Triggers whenever the price of a product's variant decreases.
    
*   **Price Increase:** Triggers whenever the price of a product's variant increases.
    

<m-info><p>Find these two triggers in Shopify Flow</p><p><img class="tiptap-image" src="https://cdn.heymantle.com/orgs/26a47f7d-a3b9-42a0-97fc-a4835cc43fbe/assets/100b3042-7847-4f9d-8e07-ef6e134f621c/image.png" alt="image"></p></m-info>

You can use these triggers to automatically notify your marketing team, update accounting sheets, or manage sales channel availability the moment a price fluctuation occurs.
